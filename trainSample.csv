1,"Average sushi. I sat at the sushi bar and the chef rarely look my way and it was slow, there was only one other person at the sushi bar! The chef never asked what I wanted, I had to approach him. Personally I will never go here again. Food is average and the service is poor. With so many sushi places here in Vegas I would recommend eating at another place."

I bout butter cookies to take to my kids and I threw them away as soon as I tasted them , bland with no butter taste. Its hard to accept criticism but I truly believe I am doing you a service. If you don't do anything to change you will see that no matter how much you are on tv customers will stop coming. If you need help I'm happy to assist."
1,"We were picking up and security made us move.  We just got there and our person was 20 feet from the car.  I'd say they the most unfriendly of the many airports I have used. I understand that there is no waiting,  but when someone is 20 feet away,  it is not waiting.  It is picking up.  Perhaps and accessible cell phone lot would be helpful.  Not an poorly make garage that only allows 15 min until you are forced to pay 3 bucks just to pick up."
1,"Yuck yuck yuck... I can't believe this place has good reviews.  It must be because a majority of the reviews are written by people who stop here after a night out of drinking.  \n\nThe other night I was craving some Mexican food and instead of going to the other Mexican joint that's less than a block away, I decided to try Amados.  Big mistake.... huge.  Sure, it's open 24 hours but, so is the competitor around the corner... and they offer tasty food!\n\nMy chicken chimichanga plate was gross on a buncha levels,  First off, it's obvious the oil hadn't been changed in a while because I could SMELL the deep-fried tortilla... and not in a good way.  After a test bite or two, I decided I'd just eat the chicken inside but, it was SOOO SALTY that I literally ended up throwing most of it out.  I have never ever done that to a chimichanga before.  :(  Finally, the beans and rice had almost no flavor.  I don't even know how that's possible... rice sure.  Beans tho?!  \n\nBecause of the 4 stars I was thinking I should give it another try but honestly, just can't stomach the idea of it.  \n\nWon't see ya there!"
1,"Worst customer service EVER!  I've never had a good experience with them, but I decided to give them a second chance because it had been years since I was last there.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO TO LENSCRAFTERS!  \n\nFirst off, the DOCTOR should explain AND hand you the contact lenses, not an employee that doesn't know the difference between TORIC and REGULAR contact lens.  You should NOT have to pay an additional $60 for 1 TORIC lens to try out.  AND when you're REFUSED to be given the prescription you were TOLD you were getting for a TORIC LENS, you should be REFUNDED that $60 for the 1 and only TORIC lens they provided you with.  Or given a store credit to apply towards something else.  Either way, I will NEVER go back to LensCrafters for anything.  They wanted to charge me $350 for lenses for my GLASSES when a frame was provided AND I have insurance.  Costco, Sam's Club, WAL-MART all about $100 when you're provided frames.  I DO NOT recommend this place if you DO have poor vision because the doctor isn't as knowledgeable as the one you're used to going to.  My fault for NOT having VSP insurance this year to see my normal doctor.  \n\nDo yourselves a favor and AVOID ALL LensCrafters stores.  They APPEAR to work off commission since they obviously don't care about your eyes and the health of your eyes!"
